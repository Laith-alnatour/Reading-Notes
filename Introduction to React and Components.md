-Reusability 
-Replaceable 
-Not context specific
-Extensible 
-Encapsulated 
-Independent 


#### **3.What are the advantages of using component-based architecture?**
-Ease of deployment
-Reduced cost
-Ease of development
-Reusable 
-Modification of technical complexity
-Reliability 
-System maintenance and evolution
-Independent 




> ## What is Props and How to Use it in React

#### **What is “props” short for?**
React is a component-based library that divides the UI into little reusable pieces. In some cases, those components need to communicate (send data to each other) and the way to pass data between components is by using props.

“Props” is a special keyword in React, which stands for properties and is being used for passing data from one component to another.

#### **How are props used in React?**

Firstly, define an attribute and its value(data)
Then pass it to child component(s) by using Props
Finally, render the Props Data

#### **What is the flow of props?**

 in a uni-directional flow. (one way from parent to child)
