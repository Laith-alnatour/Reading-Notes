### 6 Reasons for Pair Programming

1. **What are the 6 reasons for pair programming?**

      1. Greater efficiency
      2. Engaged collaboration
      3. Learning from fellow students
      4. Social skills
      5. Job interview readiness
      6. Work environment readiness



2. **In your experience, which of these reasons have you found most beneficial?**

Work environment readiness

3. **How does pair programming work?**

Pair programming touches on all four skills: developers explain out loud what the code should do, listen to others’ guidance, read code that others have written, and write code themselves.

During a five-hour paired lab session, Code Fellows students work on all four of these language-specific skills. The abilities they foster will serve them well in completing assignments, in their own communication and learning, in interviews, and in readiness for a job at a company that utilizes this agile practice.
