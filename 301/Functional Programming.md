### Functional Programming Concepts

1. **What is functional programming?**

Functional programming is a programming paradigm — a style of building the structure and elements of computer programs — that treats computation

2. **What is a pure function and how do we know if something is a pure function?**

It returns the same result if given the same arguments (it is also referred as deterministic)

3. **What are the benefits of a pure function?**

.    Given a parameter A → expect the function to return value B
.    Given a parameter C → expect the function to return value D


4. **What is immutability?**

its state cannot change after it’s created. 

5. **What is Referential transparency?**

Basically, if a function consistently yields the same result for the same input, it is referentially transparent.
