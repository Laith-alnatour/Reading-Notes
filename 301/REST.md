1. **Who is Roy Fielding?**

He helped write the first web servers, that sent documents across the internet… and then he did a ton of research explaining why the web works the way it does. His name is on the specification for the protocol that is used to get pages from servers to your browser.


2. **Why don’t the techniques that we use today work well when we need to be able to talk to all of the machines in the world?**

Because they weren't designed to be used like that. When Fielding and his colleagues started building the web, being able to talk to any machine anywhere in the world was a primary concern. 

3. **What is the HTTP protocol that Fielding and his friends created?**

first part tells the browser what protocol to use. That stuff you type in there is one of the most important breakthroughs in the history of computing


4. **What does a GET do?**

GETs using the HTTP protocol on them until all the resources are obtained and the web page is displayed. But the important thing here is that very different kinds of nouns can be treated the same. 

5. **What does a POST do?**

If one system needs to add something to another system, it would use an HTTP

6. **What does PUT do?**
