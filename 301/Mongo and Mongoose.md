### nosql vs sql

1. **Fill in the chart below with five differences between SQL and NoSQL databases:**

.SQL databases are relational, NoSQL databases are non-relational.

.SQL databases use structured query language and have a predefined schema. NoSQL databases have dynamic schemas for unstructured data.

.SQL databases are vertically scalable, while NoSQL databases are horizontally scalable.

.SQL databases are table-based, while NoSQL databases are document, key-value, graph, or wide-column stores.

.SQL databases are better for multi-row transactions, while NoSQL is better for unstructured data like documents or JSON.


2. **What kind of data is a good fit for an SQL database?**

including primary types such as Integer, Float, Decimal, Char (including character strings), Varchar (variable length character strings), binary (for unstructured blobs of data), Text (for textual data) 

Type of Data


3. **Give a real world example.**

an human resources manager may perform a query on an employee database that selects all employees in a specific department that were hired between 11 and 12 months ago

4. **What kind of data is a good fit a NoSQL database?**


JSON document

5. **Give a real world example.**

AOL, Mediamind and PayPal.

6. **Which type of database is best for hierarchical data storage?**

Document based database like MongoDB, and Redis

7. **Which type of database is best for scalability?**

Apache Cassandra is the most established scalable massive database

### sql vs nosql (Video)



1. **What does SQL stand for?**

Structured Query Language

2. **What is a relational database?**

is a type of database that stores and provides access to data points that are related to one another

3. **What type of structure does a relational database work with?**

relational model means that the logical data structures—the data tables, views, and indexes

4. **What is a ‘schema’?**

is the structure of a database described in a formal language supported by the database management system

5. **What is a NoSQL database?**

are non-tabular databases and store data differently than relational tables

6. **How does it work?**

store data in documents rather than relational tables.

7. **What is inside of a Mongo database?**

records as documents (specifically BSON documents) which are gathered together in collections. A database stores one or more collections of documents


8. **Which is more flexible - SQL or MongoDB? and why.**

 MongoDB is more flexible and ensures high and diverse data availability, a SQL Database operates with the ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, and Durability) properties and ensures greater reliability of transactions

9. **What is the disadvantage of a NoSQL database?**

 in the query language and they're not yet 100% compatible with the SQL
