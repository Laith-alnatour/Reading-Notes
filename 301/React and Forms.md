### React Docs - Forms

1. **What is a ‘Controlled Component’?**

An input form element whose value is controlled by React in this way

2. **Should we wait to store the users responses from the form into state when they submit the form OR should we update the state with their responses as soon as they enter them? Why.**

Should we wait , because is always an uncontrolled component because its value can only be set by a user, and not programmatically.

3. **How do we target what the user is entering if we have an event handler on an input field?**

The oninput event occurs when an element gets user input.



### The Conditional (Ternary) Operator Explained

1. **Why would we use a ternary operator?**

Shorten your if statements into one line of code with the conditional operator

2. **Rewrite the following statement using a ternary statement:

if(x===y){

console.log(true);

} else {

console.log(false);

}

answer : x===y  ? console.log(true) : console.log(false);
